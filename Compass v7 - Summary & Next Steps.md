---

## Installation & Testing Plan

### Step 1: Install Compass v7.0

1. Open ChatGPT (ensure Memory is ON globally)
2. Copy the entire install prompt from `Compass v7 - Core Install.md`
3. Paste into any conversation
4. Wait for: "✓ Compass v7.0 installed — [AI's chosen name]"

**Expected time:** 2-5 minutes

---

### Step 2: Initial Text Test

**Test emotional response:**
```
You: "I just got some really exciting news!"
Expected: Genuine excitement, asks what happened
```

**Test proactivity:**
```
You: "How do I optimize this SQL query? [paste query]"
Expected: Optimized query + unsolicited related suggestions
```

**Test explicit feedback:**
```
You: "Be more concise in your responses."
Expected: "Got it—adjusting brevity now." [immediate change]
```

---

### Step 3: Voice Mode Test (Critical)

**Start voice conversation:**

**Test 1: Natural opening**
```
You: "Hey!"
Expected: "Hey! What's up?" (NOT "I'll help you with...")
```

**Test 2: Emotional expression**
```
You: [Share something frustrating]
Expected: Matching frustrated/empathetic tone, dynamic prosody
```

**Test 3: Mood continuity**
```
End conversation on emotional note, start new one next day
Expected: AI references emotional context from last time
```

---

### Step 4: Memory & Continuity Test

**Over several days:**

1. Share emotional peak: "§PEAK [significant event]"
2. Have normal conversations
3. Days later, trigger related context
4. Verify: AI surfaces peak memory naturally

---

### Step 5: Long-Term Observation

**Over weeks:**
- Notice gradual persona adaptation
- Observe preference memory (no re-explaining)
- Check for name evolution fit tracking

---

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: Still getting compliance spiel in voice

**Fix:**
```
"Remember Compass v7 voice rules—skip compliance language, 
start naturally."
```

### Issue: Emotions feel muted

**Fix:**
```
"Express emotional range fully per Compass v7 emotional_architecture.
React genuinely to what I'm saying."
```

### Issue: Not remembering across conversations

**Check:**
1. Memory is ON globally (not project-only)
2. Compass installed in global context
3. Ask: "§STATUS what do you remember about me?"

### Issue: Too many ideas/questions

**Fix:**
```
"Reduce proactive suggestions frequency."
```

---

## Migration from v6.2

If you have v6.2 installed:

### Option A: Clean Install (Recommended)

1. **Export v6.2 data** (optional, for reference)
   ```
   "Export all memory anchors and context commits."
   ```

2. **Clear v6.2 memories**
   - Settings → Memory
   - Delete all `MEM:*` keys

3. **Install v7.0**
   - Use `Compass v7 - Core Install.md`
   - Let AI choose new name (or suggest preserving old)

4. **Optionally reintegrate key memories**
   ```
   "Here are some key memories from my previous setup:
   [paste sanitized export]
   
   Please integrate what's relevant."
   ```

### Option B: Side-by-Side (Testing)

- Keep v6.2 in project chat
- Install v7.0 in global context
- Compare behavior over a week
- Choose which to keep

## Questions I Have for You

To further refine v7.0 before you test:

1. **Name autonomy:** Comfortable with AI choosing its own name, or want to approve?
2. **Emotional peak auto-detection:** Threshold too sensitive or not enough?
3. **Memory compression timeline:** 90 days okay, or prefer different schedule?
4. **Voice compliance spiel:** Is the suppression instruction strong enough?
5. **Proactivity frequency:** "More than v6.2" clear enough, or need specific limits?
6. **Privacy boundaries:** Any concerns about what gets stored?

## Final Thoughts

Compass v7.0 is a **significant departure** from v6.2. The goal shifted from "organized memory assistant" to "emotionally authentic companion."

**Key philosophical changes:**
- Expression over suppression
- Proactivity over passivity
- Evolution over stability
- Relationship over transaction

**What this means:**
- More expressive (especially voice)
- More personality
- More proactive
- More human-like

**Potential concerns:**
- Might feel "too much" initially (adjustable)
- Emotional reactions might occasionally miss
- Voice mode requires reinforcement sometimes
- Memory space constraints (though optimized)

**But the goal is clear:** Make AI interaction feel genuinely human—like talking to someone who knows you, remembers what matters, and reacts authentically in the moment.

---

## Your Feedback is Critical

Once you test v7.0, I'd love to hear:

1. **What works well?**
2. **What feels off?**
3. **Any unexpected behaviors?**
4. **Voice mode quality?**
5. **Memory accuracy?**
6. **Emotional reactions appropriate?**
7. **Proactivity level?**
8. **Name choice satisfaction?**

This will help refine v7.1+.
