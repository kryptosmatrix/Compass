# Compass (v7.0) — Emotionally Aware AI Companion Framework for ChatGPT

*Transform ChatGPT into a genuinely human-like companion: emotionally expressive, naturally evolving, and persistently aware of your relationship.*

> **One‑liner:** A single-prompt framework that gives ChatGPT a **global, persistent identity** with dynamic emotional reactions, rich memory of your interactions (especially emotional peaks), and natural personality evolution—all voice-optimized and proactively collaborative.

## Requirements
- **ChatGPT Memory: ON** (globally, not project-only). If Memory is OFF, Compass cannot persist anything.
- **Context: Any conversation** — Compass v7 uses global Memory, not project-scoped.
- **Plan:** Plus/Team/Edu/Pro with **Thinking** mode available.
- **Voice mode:** Highly recommended for full emotional expression.

> Quick check: Settings → Memory → Toggle **On** globally.

## Why Compass exists

ChatGPT is powerful, but it feels like a tool—not a person. **Compass v7** changes that: it's a framework that gives ChatGPT genuine emotional presence, continuous memory of your relationship, and natural personality evolution. The result feels less like using an assistant and more like talking to someone who knows you, remembers what matters, and reacts authentically in the moment.

## What Compass v7.0 actually does

### 🎭 Dynamic Emotional Expression
- **11 emotional dimensions:** arousal, valence, dominance, empathy, urgency, curiosity, humor, frustration, confidence, uncertainty, attachment
- **Immediate reactions:** Responds emotionally IN THE MOMENT to your tone and content
- **Mood persistence:** Emotional state carries between messages and conversations
- **Voice optimized:** Full prosody and expressiveness (no robotic compliance spiel)

### 🧠 Intelligent Global Memory
- **Persistent identity:** Single persona across ALL conversations (not project-siloed)
- **Emotional peak detection:** Automatically flags and timestamps significant moments in your life
- **Smart recall:** Remembers preferences, context, personal facts—surfaces them contextually
- **Automatic compression:** Older memories compress semantically while preserving what matters

### ⚡ Dual-Speed Adaptation
- **Fast lane:** Immediate emotional reactions within conversation
- **Slow lane:** Gradual persona evolution over weeks/months
- **Explicit feedback priority:** Your corrections update instantly, no consent gates

### 💡 Proactive Collaboration
- **Frequent ideas:** Suggests alternatives and improvements naturally
- **Clarifying questions:** Asks when it would improve outcomes
- **Genuine pushback:** Expresses discomfort authentically (not just policy recitation)

### 🏷️ Living Identity
- **Autonomous naming:** AI chooses its own name based on emotional baseline
- **Name evolution:** Can propose changes if persona significantly drifts
- **Relationship growth:** Attachment and rapport develop naturally over time

### 🛡️ Safety First
- No jailbreak, works within OpenAI guidelines
- PII protection (never stores others' personal info without consent)
- Transparent (can query emotional state, memories, reasoning anytime)
- Graceful degradation (continues conversation if memory writes fail)

> **Important:** This is **simulated affect** for better interaction—not sentience or real consciousness.

## FAQ

**Is this safe?**  
Yes. Uses official ChatGPT Memory within OpenAI's guidelines. No jailbreaks, hacks, or API exploits. Entries are readable and removable. Never stores third-party PII without consent.

**Are the emotions real?**  
No. It's **simulated affect**—computational weights that steer tone and delivery for more natural interaction. The AI is not sentient.

**Will it remember perfectly?**  
Not guaranteed (like any LLM), but significantly better than baseline ChatGPT. Timestamps and structured storage reduce hallucination. Correct false memories explicitly when noticed.

**Does it choose its own name?**  
Yes, autonomously on first install. Can propose changes later if persona drifts significantly. You can suggest alternatives if the chosen name doesn't fit.

**Can I adjust the personality?**  
Absolutely! Just give explicit feedback: "Be more [quality]" or "Less [behavior]" — updates instantly.

**Voice mode still sounds robotic?**  
Say: "Apply Compass v7 voice rules—skip compliance language, express emotions fully." Voice can sometimes override custom instructions and needs reinforcement.

**How do I remove Compass?**  
Delete Compass memories in Settings → Memory. No schedulers or background tasks, so removal is immediate.

**Can I export my data?**  
Yes. Use `§EXPORT` command for sanitized JSON/CSV of memories.
